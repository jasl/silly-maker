# SillyMaker architecture

状态：持续维护的现状文档。最后结构性复核：2026-07-19。

本文描述当前实现的主要边界和数据流。它不是冻结 ABI；修改包职责、权威状态、Story 组合、持久化格式或公开入口时，应同时更新本文、相应类型和行为测试。

## 1. System context

SillyMaker 是浏览器优先、可 headless 运行的 Story 游戏引擎。Project Tavern 是使用它开发的具体游戏。引擎提供可组合的规则运行时、权威 Session、存档/诊断、React presentation 和 Web Host；Story 提供具体 State、Command、规则、查询、内容、Scene 和应用组合。

当前所有 workspace package 都是 `private`。本文所说的“公开 API”指 package `exports` 暴露的仓库内受支持入口，不表示 npm 发布承诺。

```text
Project Tavern Story and application
          |            |            |
          v            v            v
 @sillymaker/base  @sillymaker/ui  @sillymaker/web
       contracts      React UI      browser Host
       runtime                      and adapters
```

依赖方向保持从具体游戏指向通用引擎。Base 不依赖 React、DOM、浏览器或具体 Story；UI 和 Web 可以依赖 Base；具体 Story/application 可以依赖三个引擎包。

## 2. Package responsibilities

| Package                     | Workspace public entries                     | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `@sillymaker/base`          | `.`, `./authoring`, `./runtime`, `./testkit` | Contracts, authoring definitions and kit, deterministic resolution, authoritative sessions, persistence orchestration, replay, diagnostics, the agent port, and reusable behavior-test helpers.    |
| `@sillymaker/tooling`       | `.`                                          | Node-only tooling: the JSONL agent host protocol and client. Project/config/build commands land here in later milestones. Never imported by Base/UI browser bundles.                               |
| `@sillymaker/ui`            | `.`, `./assets`, `./debug`, `./diagnostics`  | React shell, stage, characters, assets, interaction/input, overlays, narrative, settings, semantic/presentation bridges, and recovery UI.                                                          |
| `@sillymaker/web`           | `.`                                          | Browser Host, IndexedDB record storage, files/images, mounting, routing, pointer input, capabilities, automation, Loader, and HMR rebootstrap.                                                     |

| `@project-tavern/story-poc` | `.`, plus optional tooling entries           | Current Project Tavern Story definition, gameplay, presentation catalogs, semantic actions, application composition, and Story-specific tools. It is an example under redesign, not an engine API. |

Cross-package imports use package exports and declared `workspace:*` dependencies. Application-only composition may stay internal to a Story package when no other package should consume it.

Implementation anchors:

- Base root exports: `engine/packages/base/src/index.ts`
- Base runtime exports: `engine/packages/base/src/runtime/index.ts`
- UI exports: `engine/packages/ui/src/index.ts`
- Web exports: `engine/packages/web/src/index.ts`
- current Story root: `game/stories/poc/src/index.ts`

## 3. Story resolution

A Story package supplies a `GamePackageV1` with two facets:

- **Simulation**: state contract, module composition, schemas, commands, rule/value program, queries, and ViewModel projection.
- **Presentation**: scene graph, text and asset catalogs, presentation values, and renderer identifiers.

`defineGamePackage` creates the package entry. `resolveGamePackageV1` validates the definition, applies authorized simulation and presentation patches, materializes both facets, derives technical provenance, and returns a frozen `ResolvedGameV1`.

Simulation and presentation patch surfaces are deliberately separate. A simulation patch can change rules or values and therefore simulation identity; a presentation patch can change values, text, or assets without pretending to be a gameplay migration. Hotfix support is an application bootstrap mechanism, not a general script runtime.

Resolved provenance distinguishes Story identity, engine identity, state-contract identity, simulation digest, presentation digest, and patch-set identity. These fields let Save, HMR, diagnostics, and release tooling reason about compatibility without using the application version as a substitute for actual runtime identity.

## 4. Simulation and authoritative state

A `GameplayModuleDescriptorV1` declares a stable module ID, revision, owned State slots, and dependencies. Stateful modules provide schema, initial State, local queries, owner-scoped proposals/apply operations, and invariants. Stateless modules may provide named pure capabilities.

`defineGameSimulation` combines the selected module tuple with aggregate schemas and Story-owned behavior:

- bootstrap and initial-State factories;
- gameplay and debug command executors;
- `createQueries(State)`;
- immutable game ViewModel projection.

The current validator checks unique State ownership and an acyclic module dependency graph. A Story's aggregate State should reflect the modules it actually composes; unused modules should not force placeholder State.

The authoritative runtime value is a `GameSnapshot`:

```text
GameSnapshot = Gameplay State + serializable RNG state
             + command sequence + run integrity
```

Gameplay State remains plain, versioned, schema-validated data. RNG is serializable and transaction-local so a rejected or faulted attempt cannot silently consume randomness. Command logs and emitted facts are diagnostic evidence, not a second source of State.

## 5. Session and semantic read/write flow

One `GameSession` owns the current Snapshot. Its queue serializes authoritative dispatch, lifecycle replacement, validated load/import, debug mutation, and other operations that can replace State. A command attempt either installs one complete valid Snapshot or leaves the previous Snapshot authoritative.

Read and presentation flow:

```text
GameSimulation
  -> GameQueries over Gameplay State
  -> immutable SemanticPublication
  -> RuntimePresentationPublication
  -> React renderer
```

The semantic port previews and dispatches Story-specific semantic invocations at the Session queue boundary. UI, browser automation, and presentation code consume projections and semantic descriptors; they do not receive a Snapshot setter or a generic gameplay-State client.

Renderer-local hover, animation, focus, overlay, and asset-loading state is non-authoritative. It may produce semantic or presentation intents, but it cannot independently decide gameplay availability or mutate Gameplay State.

## 6. Persistence and browser storage

Persistence is separate from live State management:

```text
authoritative in-memory Snapshot
  -> versioned Save envelope and provenance
  -> HostAtomicRecordStore
  -> browser IndexedDB adapter
```

`HostAtomicRecordStoreV1` is a revisioned byte-record interface used for saves, leases, and settings. `createWebHostV1` supplies its IndexedDB implementation plus browser entropy, file, clock, navigation, and logging ports. Tests or other Hosts can inject a different record store without moving browser concerns into Base.

A Save carries its Snapshot, state digest, provenance, and simulation lineage. Import/load validates bytes, schema, identity, references, and invariants before replacing the live replay anchor. Internal indexes, clients, closures, React values, and database handles must not enter a Save.

IndexedDB therefore remains durable storage, not the live query API. A future typed in-memory store may change how Gameplay State is accessed internally while preserving this persistence boundary.

## 7. Diagnostics, capabilities, and recovery

Base runtime provides bounded command logs and runtime failures, DebugBundle encoding/decoding, privacy scrubbing, best-effort and authoritative replay, persistence services, and capability-aware debug operations.

Runtime capabilities currently include debug tools, cheats, and a browser automation bridge. Capabilities are checked at operation time and do not create a second build flavor. Automation exposes the Story's semantic surface rather than internal debug or State mutation APIs.

The Web Loader can resolve a Story with Hotfixes and retain the last successful identity for recovery. HMR compares resolved identity, invalidates the previous runtime, fences persistence ownership, and constructs a successor application instead of mutating a live simulation definition in place.

## 8. Presentation architecture

`@sillymaker/ui` separates reusable rendering infrastructure from Story-owned appearance and content:

- a shell and central layered stage;
- stable renderer-ID contribution registries;
- scene, character, HUD, narrative, overlay, system, and interaction surfaces;
- semantic-publication and runtime-presentation stores;
- asset registry, exact-demand loading, diagnostics, and code-native fallback;
- input routing, pointer hit testing, accessibility-oriented controls, and settings;
- Save and diagnostic UI ports that do not own persistence or gameplay logic.

Story presentation code maps its immutable semantic publication and catalogs into these generic surfaces. Missing assets or renderer contributions can degrade to a visible fallback without changing authoritative gameplay.

## 9. Changing the architecture

Architecture evolution is expected. A substantial change should state:

1. which package owns the new responsibility;
2. which public types or data formats change;
3. whether existing Saves or Story definitions need migration;
4. how authoritative state and failure atomicity remain unambiguous;
5. what behavior-level tests demonstrate the new contract;
6. which active documents now describe it.

Historical Phase plans and contract catalogs are evidence of one implementation journey, not approval requirements for the next design.

The accepted evolution beyond this live baseline is tracked in the [engine roadmap](roadmap.md), [AI authoring design](design/ai-authoring.md), [E2E engine validation design](design/e2e-engine-validation.md), and [VN presentation runtime design](design/vn-presentation-runtime.md). Those documents do not alter the current data flow until their implementation and behavior tests land.
